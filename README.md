# PrOfESSOS
PrOfESSOS is our open source implementation for fully automated Evaluation-as-a-Service for SSO.
PrOfESSOS introduces a generic approach to improve the security of OpenID Connect implementations by systematically detecting vulnerabilities.

A user of PrOfESSOS – the penetration tester – can access it on its website. 
We provide a running demo of PrOfESSOS at https://openid.sso-security.de.
On the website, the penetration tester can configure it.
Basically, this means that he enters the URL of the target SP and selects the to be tested attacks.
PrOfESSOS itself makes use of the other components in the background, which are described in the following.
These components interact with each other and the target SP, perform the attacks, evaluate if they are successful, and presents the results.
